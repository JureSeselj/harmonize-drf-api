## Validation

### PEP8 Validation

All code was formatted using [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/).
Additionally, manual validation was done with [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com).

The only code which was left with long-line prompts is `settings.py` for code functionality.

## Testing

The following tests were carried out on the app:
1. Manual testing of user stories
2. Automated testing

### Manual testing of user stories

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, posts, comments and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User | Create, update & delete user | A user can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
User | Change permissions | User permissions can be updated | Works as expected
Profile | Create, update & delete | User profile can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Post | Create, update & delete | A post can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Comment | Create, update & delete | A comment can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Like | Create & delete | A like can be created or deleted (like / unlike post) | Works as expected
Follower | Create & delete | Follow or unfollow user | Works as expected

In addition, posts, comments, likes and following can be created by logged-in users only. Users can only update or delete the content which was created by themselves.
