# Harmonize - Django REST Framework API

# Overview

This repository serves as Harmonize App Backend REST API. The purpose is to provide data to be used in Front-End design with [React. js](https://reactjs.org/). For the main projects documentation refer to [Harmonize](https://github.com/JureSeselj/harmonize-drf-api) project.
The API endpoint can be found [here](https://harmonize-drf-api.herokuapp.com/)

## User Stories - UX

The back-end section of the project focuses on its administration side and covers one user story:
- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, posts, comments and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content.

## Database

The following models were created to represent the database model structure of the application:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used as a remote repository to store project code
- [Gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) - a virtual IDE workspace used to build this site
- [APITestCase](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/) - Django Rest Framework APITestCase was used for automated testing
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to store static files
- [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.4.4/) used to produce automated testing report
- [Dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) used for the database schema diagram
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control via Gitpod terminal to push the code to GitHub
- [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) was used to build the back-end API
- [Django AllAuth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) was used for user authentication

- [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) â€“ deployed project on Heroku uses a ElephantSQL database

## Validation

### PEP8 Validation

All code was formatted using [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/).
Additionally, manual validation was done with [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com).

The only code which was left with long-line prompts is `settings.py` for code functionality.

## Testing

The following tests were carried out on the app:
1. Manual testing of user stories
2. Automated testing

### Manual testing of user stories

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, posts, comments and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User | Create, update & delete user | A user can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
User | Change permissions | User permissions can be updated | Works as expected
Profile | Create, update & delete | User profile can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Post | Create, update & delete | A post can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Comment | Create, update & delete | A comment can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Like | Create & delete | A like can be created or deleted (like / unlike post) | Works as expected
Follower | Create & delete | Follow or unfollow user | Works as expected

In addition, posts, comments, likes and following can be created by logged-in users only. Users can only update or delete the content which was created by themselves.
